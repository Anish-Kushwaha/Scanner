## 🔧 How It Works

### 🔄 Scanning Process Flow

1. Target Input: User enters URL (auto-fixes missing scheme)
2. Reconnaissance: DNS resolution, WHOIS lookup, geolocation
3. Network Scan: Port scanning on common ports (21-8888)
4. Web Analysis: XSS, SQLi, directory traversal testing
5. Plesk Detection: Specialized Plesk panel scanning
6. Report Generation: JSON report compilation and download

### ⚙️ Technical Architecture

· Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
· Backend: Flask (Python) with REST API
· Database: JSON file storage (no external DB required)
· Security: Rate limiting, timeout handling, error management
· Performance: Multi-threaded scanning for speed optimization

### 🎯 Key Algorithms

1. Port Scanner: TCP SYN-based connection testing
2. Banner Grabbing: HTTP HEAD requests for service identification
3. Vulnerability Matching: Regex pattern matching for known CVEs
4. DNS Resolution: Parallel DNS record type queries
5. Geolocation: IP-based geographic data retrieval

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Basic Usage

```python
# After installation, simply run:
python app.py
# Then open http://localhost:5000
```

### 2️⃣ Target Format Examples

```
Valid target formats:
- https://example.com
- http://example.com:8080
- example.com:8443 (auto-fixes to https)
- 192.168.1.1
- 192.168.1.1:443
```

### 3️⃣ Scanning Parameters

· Timeout: 5 seconds per request
· Port Range: 21-8888 (common services)
· Threads: 10 concurrent connections
· Rate Limit: 10ms between requests

## **📊 Scanner Modules**

### 🔌 Network Scanner

```python
# Scans these ports by default:
COMMON_PORTS = [21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 110, 139, 143, 
                443, 445, 3306, 3389, 8080, 8443, 8888]

# Banner grabbing for:
BANNER_GRAB_PORTS = [21, 22, 23, 25, 80, 110, 143, 
                     443, 3306, 3389]
```

### 🕸️ Web Vulnerability Checks
```
· XSS Payload: <script>alert('XSS')</script>
· SQLi Payload: ' OR '1'='1
· Directory List: /admin, /backup, /config, /logs
· Known Paths: /.env, /config.php, /.git/config

🚨 Vulnerability Patterns Detected

Pattern Vulnerability Severity
Apache/2.2 CVE-2017-5638 High
PHP/5.x Multiple CVEs Critical
nginx/1.x Known vulnerabilities Medium
IIS/6.x Multiple CVEs High
