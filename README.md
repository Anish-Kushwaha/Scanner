## 🔧 How It Works

### 🔄 Scanning Process Flow

1. Target Input: User enters URL (auto-fixes missing scheme)
2. Reconnaissance: DNS resolution, WHOIS lookup, geolocation
3. Network Scan: Port scanning on common ports (21-8888)
4. Web Analysis: XSS, SQLi, directory traversal testing
5. Plesk Detection: Specialized Plesk panel scanning
6. Report Generation: JSON report compilation and download

### ⚙️ Technical Architecture

· Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
· Backend: Flask (Python) with REST API
· Database: JSON file storage (no external DB required)
· Security: Rate limiting, timeout handling, error management
· Performance: Multi-threaded scanning for speed optimization

### 🎯 Key Algorithms

1. Port Scanner: TCP SYN-based connection testing
2. Banner Grabbing: HTTP HEAD requests for service identification
3. Vulnerability Matching: Regex pattern matching for known CVEs
4. DNS Resolution: Parallel DNS record type queries
5. Geolocation: IP-based geographic data retrieval

## Android app (APK)

The repository includes a native Android WebView container for the live Scanner web application.

### Build locally

Requirements: JDK 17 and Android SDK (API 35).

```bash
cd android
gradle --no-daemon assembleDebug
```

The debug APK is generated at:

`android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

### Build from GitHub Actions

Open **Actions → Android APK → Run workflow** (or push a change under `android/`). Download the `scanner-android-debug` artifact from the completed workflow run. Pull requests also compile the Android app.

The Android shell loads the existing hosted Scanner UI at `https://scanner-rose-rho.vercel.app/`. The backend must remain deployed and reachable for live scanning. The APK does not bundle a private backend or credentials.

### Android security and behavior

- HTTPS only; cleartext traffic, mixed content, local file access, and content access are disabled.
- External HTTPS navigation is handed to the Android browser.
- The app handles offline/network errors with a retry screen.
- Debug APKs are unsigned and intended for testing. A distributable signed release requires a signing key managed outside the repository (for example, GitHub Actions secrets).
- Use the scanner only against systems you own or are explicitly authorized to assess.
